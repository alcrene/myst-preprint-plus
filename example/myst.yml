    Features especially useful for manuscripts which one intends to a journal:
    - Page geometry options which approxmiate page sizes of specific journals.
    - Support for both Appendix and Supplementary Information (SI):
      SI is printed to separate pages, with its own title, so it can easily be
      split from the main PDF and submitted separately.
      (While retaining the ability to use cross-references to the main text.)
    Based on the `arxiv_two_column` by Brenhin Keller.

  # parts:
  #   -> page frontmatter
  # NB: As of v1.6.0, project-level parts are not picked up.
  #     Define them in the page frontmatter instead.

  # exports:
  #   -> page frontmatter
  # NB: As of v1.6.0, the project-level `exports` map is ignored when compiling
  #     single pages. It needs to be provided in the page frontmatter.
